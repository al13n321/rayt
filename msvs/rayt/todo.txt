Change GPU data format to allow more than 2^23 nodes in cache.
Find out if it's UB to upload non-intersecting changes to the same buffer simultaneously (intersecting ones are apparently UB).
Fix CLBuffer to take this into account.
Fix GPUOctreeCache to use less blocking (also find out if blocking is equivalent to clFinish, and if not, even current blocking-everything implementation is invalid).
Fix large files.
Implement feedback with hacky kernel.
