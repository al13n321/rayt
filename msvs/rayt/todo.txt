Current blocking sucks. Use top-down bfs-dfs approach.
	Apparently top-down BFS approach sucks too, but in a different way. Add deep child grouping and modify storage data format to support it.
Rename StoredOctreeWriter to StoredOctreeBuilderOld, StoredOctreeRawWriter to StoredOctreeWriter.
Visualize depth and block index. Check if blocking exploits spatial coherence by any chance.
Decrease LOD when cache is too small
Beam optimization
Visualize block load time
Visualize iteration count
Lighting
Textures
Reflections
Nicer scenes
