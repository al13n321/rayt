Blocking is terrible. Try another strategy. Sort unfinished child blocks by depth and force detach subtrees of depth at least 5. If it works, think of a better form of this approach.
Visualize depth and block index. Check if blocking exploits spatial coherence by any chance.
Decrease LOD when cache is too small
Beam optimization
Visualize block load time
Visualize iteration count
Lighting
Textures
Reflections
Nicer scenes
