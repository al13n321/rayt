Refracting and and reflecting surfaces are (going to be) supported. Hard shadows are supported.

Rendering kernel outputs the following for each pixel:
1) Blending state:
	- Color, accumulated so far. Zeros initially. Just color, if there's no fault. Zero, if there's a fault and no secondary rays.
	- Accumulated color multiplier (3 components). Ones initially.
2) Fault block index or -1.
3) Hit node. In case of fault, parent of fault node.
4) Dumped tracing state in case of fault. Fault can be either during casting ordinary ray or shadow ray. If shadow ray t is -1, it's ordinary ray, otherwise it's shadow ray.
	- Ray origin.
	- Ray direction. In case of shadow fault, it's ordinary ray direction before reflecting/refracting (if any).
	- LOD of non-shadow ray at the origin.
	- LOD increase along non-shadow ray.
	- Shadow ray direction. Shadow ray origin coincides with ray origin.
	- Shadow ray t. If -1, it's ordinary (non-shadow) fault.
	- Shadow ray light source index.

TODO: LOD change for secondary and shadow rays.
