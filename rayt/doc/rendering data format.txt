Refracting and and reflecting surfaces are (going to be) supported.
Only one path is traced for each pixel. It can change direction (for reflection OR refraction) after hitting surfaces, but it can't create additional rays (for shadows or reflecting-AND-refracting surfaces).

Rendering kernel outputs the following for each pixel:
1) Blending state:
	- Color, accumulated so far. Zeros initially. Just color, if there's no fault. Zero, if there's a fault and no secondary rays.
	- Color multiplier, accumulated so far (3 components). Ones initially. Zeroes indicate that this pixel is rendered completely (i.e. there's no fault).
2) Fault block index or hit node index. Let the value be x.
	If x < 0, fault block global index is -x-1.
	If x == NO_HIT (=2^31-1), there's no hit (during this pass).
	If x > 0, hit node index is x/2-1. If x % 2 == 1, hit node has duplication flag set (i.e. it's a duplicate of a node in parent block).
3) Tracing state in case of fault.
	- Ray origin.
	- Ray direction.
	- LOD at the origin of the ray.
	- LOD increase along the ray.
	- Index of parent of fault node. To use it if fault is not fulfiled.
	- Number of reflections/refractions occured. To stop if it's too big.
