GPU representation of octree consists of paraller buffers and textures called channels. One of the channels is node link buffer. Other channels are optional and not interpreted by streamer.

Node link buffer format.
uint *nodes;
Let nodes[i] & 255 = m, nodes[i] >> 8 = p.
m is the mask of non-empty children.
If m != 0, p is either FAULT_NODE or a pointer to the first non-empty child. Other non-empty children follow it consecutively.
