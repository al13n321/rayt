GPU representation of octree consists of paraller buffers and textures called channels. One of the channels is node link buffer. Other channels are optional and not interpreted by streamer.

Node link buffer cache format.
uint *nodes;
Let nodes[i] & 255 = m, (nodes[i] >> 8) & 1 = t, nodes[i] >> 9 = p.
m is the mask of non-empty children.
If m == 0, f and p are undefined. Otherwise
    if t == 0, p is index in cache of the first non-empty child,
    if t == 1, p is the index of block in which children are located.




Future format:

Node link buffer cache format.

uint *nodes;
uint *far_pointers;

Let nodes[i] & 255 = m, (nodes[i] >> 8) & 1 = t, nodes[i] >> 9 = v.
m is the mask of non-empty children.

If m == 0,
	t and v are undefined,
else
    if t == 0, let f = v & 1, p = v >> 1,
		if f == 0, i + p - (1 << 21) is the index in cache of the first non-empty child,
		else, far_pointers[p] is the index in cache of the first non-empty child,
    else, children are not loaded in cache, and v is the (global, not in cache) index of block in which children are located.
